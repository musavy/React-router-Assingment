      <p>
        I arrived at Integrify Academy at 9:00 AM. Early morning, I started code
        review with my classmates (code mates) for about an hour. I had a scrum
        meeting for about 10 minutes which started at 10:00 AM. After that, I
        attended a lesson about redux and react-redux for about an hour. After
        the lesson, I was working on a new assingment. This assingment was meant
        to teach react, react-router, react-redux. So, to summarize my day was
        full of coding. I have been coding all day long. Wasn't it fun? Anyways,
        coding is my life and I couldn't live without coding. I wonder what my
        life would have been if there was no coding? Don't get me wrong! I don't
        mean coding make me happy all day long. Sometimes it makes you feel sad
        when you don't solve some problems and challenges, but what is life
        without a challenge~
